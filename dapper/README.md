## Installation

See [README/Installation](https://github.com/nansencenter/DAPPER#Installation)

## Usage

See [README/Getting-started](https://github.com/nansencenter/DAPPER#Getting-started)

Then, adapt one of the
[example scripts](https://github.com/nansencenter/DAPPER/tree/master/examples)
to your needs. Make sure you have a working adaptation of `examples/basic_1.py`
before adapting `basic_2` and `basic_3`.

If, in particular, you wish to illustrate and run benchmarks with
your own **model** or **method**, then

- If it is a complex one, you may be better off using DAPPER
  merely as *inspiration* (but you can still
  [cite it](https://github.com/nansencenter/DAPPER#getting-started))
  rather than trying to squeeze everything into its templates.
- If it is relatively simple, however, you may well want to use DAPPER.
  In that case, read this:
    - `mods`
    - `da_methods`

Since the generality of DAPPER is
[limited](https://github.com/nansencenter/DAPPER#similar-projects)
it is quite likely you will also need to make changes to the DAPPER code itself.
